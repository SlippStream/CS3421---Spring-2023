As a retrospective over the assignments in this course (as of today, January 18, 2023),
I feel that I learned a lot from implementing these systems from the "bottom-up."

I realize the likelihood of bugs creeping into my code, especially in earlier assignments,
is quite high. I took care to ensure the output of my program matched that of the 
provided files, but that only does so much. Looking forward to the exams :)
